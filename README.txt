Frontend Web Developer Nanodegree Arcade Game

To start the game, open index.html in a browser.
The object of the game is to get the player from the grass to the water
without squashing any bugs, who are crawling across the pavement.
To move the player, use the 4 arrow keys.
The player will go back to the starting place
whenever there is a collision or
when the player attempts to go outside the borders or
when the player successfully makes it to the water.
If the player crosses to the water 100 times, she wins and the game is over.
If the player squashes 100 bugs, she loses and the game is over.
